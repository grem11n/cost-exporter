### Additional information for users from Russia and Belarus

- Russia has [illegally annexed Crimea in 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation) and [brought the war in Donbas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Donbas) followed by [full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine).
- Russia has brought sorrow and devastations to millions of Ukrainians, killed hundreds of innocent people, damaged thousands of buildings, and forced several million people to flee.

Cost Exporter is a small tool that gets your cost and usage metrics from AWS Cost
Explorer and outputs them in the Prometheus format.

## Motivation

The main motivation for this project is because I can.

There are other similar projects out there (see the "[Inspiration](#inspiration)" section)
but each of them seems to solve a very special use case of their respective creators.

Thus, I have created another project that solves my special use case!

There is however a general purpose [Cost Exporter by Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/cloudcost-exporter).
You should use that one if you're planning to run things in production,
because it's maintained by an actual company and not a random dude on the internet,
who spends half a year battling the weather-induced depresion.

Still, by the time I discovered the Grafana's exporter, I have already started some work related to this one.
In theory, this exporter should also be fairely extensible both in terms of the cloud probider support (see the
and in terms of the available formats and output methods (see the "[Implementation](#implementation)" section for more information).

However, I work with AWS, so only AWS is supported for now. Also, the metrcs are available
in the Prometheus format on an HTTP endpoint, because this is kind of the industry standard.

## Usage

### Kubernetes

Cost Exporter comes with a [Helm](https://helm.sh/) chart, so you can deploy into a Kubernetes cluster.
The chart is located in the [`charts/cost-exporter`](./charts/cost-exporter) directory of
this repository.

To install it using the Helm chart, do:

```bash
helm repo add ...
```

```bash
helm upgrade --install cost-exporter charts/cost-exporter --set serviceAccount.awsRoleArn="..."
```

You need to provide an IAM Role ARN, so the Cost Exporter pods can access AWS API,
as well as the required configuration for AWS Cost Explorer.

For the rest of the available Helm values, see the README in the [chart directory](./charts/cost-exporter/README.md).

### Configuration

There is an example configuration available in the [`config.example.yaml`](./config.example.yaml) file.

Cost Exporter tries to use sane defaults, so you only really need to care about which metrics
do you want to expose.

### Prometheus

Currently, only the Prometheus format is supported, and the exporter outpts mertics on an HTTP endpoint.
You can configure both the port and the endpoint to scrape the metrics, though.

## Observability

### Metrics

On top of the cost metrics, Cost Explorer also outputs some custom metrics on the same endpoint.
Here's the list of available internal metrics with their types, units and descriptions.

| Metric Name                               | Type        | Unit | Description                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------- |
| aws_calls_total                           | `count`     |      | Total calls made to AWS API               |
| aws_get_metrics_duration                  | `histogram` | `ms` | Duration of API calls to AWS              |
| cost_metrics_total                        | `counter`   |      | Total number of the exported cost metrics |
| prometheus_aws_convertion_duration_bucket | `histogram` | `ms` | Time it takes to convert the cost metrics |

### Logs

Cost Exporter uses [Uber's `zap`](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) library to provide structured logs.
You can control the verbosity using the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.
Standard log levels are available, e.g. `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `ERROR`, etc.

The default log level is set to `INFO`.

## Implementation

In nutshell, Cost Exporter is just a bunch of control loops that use a single exchange point.

There are three types of loops:

- **Clients**: cloud provider clients, take care of retrieving metrics from the cloud provider API
- **Converters**: take care of converting whatever format a cloud provider provides into th e output format e.g. Prometheus. For now, I assume that while there can be multiple cloud clients, there should be only a single output format
- **Outputs**: "metric sinks", take care of providing converted metrics to the clients

All the loops use a single `sync.Map` as an exchange point.

```mermaid

    CC[Cloud Client] -->|Fetch data from the cloud API| CA[Cache]
    CA -->|Get raw cost metrics from cache| CV[Converter]
    CV -->|Put converted metrics| CA
    CA -->|Get converted metrics| O[Output]
    O --> CL([Client])
```

Clients, converters, and outputs are implemented as registries of plugins.
Thus, it should be relatively easy to add new ones.
However, I personally believe that that is only make sense to have a single converted format per exporter.

### Implemented so Far

- **Cloud Clients**:
  - AWS
- **Converters**:
  - AWS to Prometheus
- **Outputs**:
  - HTTP listener

## Further Thoughts

Since each client, converter, and output is essentially a plugin, it's possible to extend this exporter
to support other cloud providers, output formats, and metric sinks.

For example, it should be possible to add a client for Azure or Google Cloud.
However, I am personally not familiar with these providers.
Also, it should be possible to, for example, push metrics to DataDog using their metrics format.

## Contribution

Since it's not particularly likely that I will do any serious updates to this project,
feel free to create a PR!

Otherwise, create an new issue with your feedback and suggestions!
